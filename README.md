# Finance Bank Loan Analysis – Multi-Tool Dashboard Project
## Project Overview

This project analyzes bank loan data using two datasets:

Finance_1 → Loan and borrower information.

Finance_2 → Credit history and repayment information.

The project covers the complete ETL process, data cleaning, and merging datasets in Excel, followed by the creation of dashboards in Excel, Tableau, and Power BI using key performance indicators (KPIs). Additionally, SQL queries are written to extract meaningful insights from the data

## Tools Used
Excel → Data preparation, merging, and visualization.

Tableau → Advanced interactive dashboard design.

Power BI → Report generation from SQL database.

SQL → Queries for KPI calculations and dataset exploration.
